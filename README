Uses setuid helpers which set the user directly to the user the CGI program
will run as instead of switching to root and then back to the target
user. The sysadmin can control which users can run CGI scripts by 
controlling the installed helper binaries.

Also reads a pair of text files to determine exactly what CGI scripts are
allowed to run for each user.
